- Download and place files in `public/` directory

### 3. Screenshots

## üîß Current Status
Your PWA foundation is complete! The main missing pieces are:
1. **Icon files** - Need actual PNG/ICO files
2. **Screenshots** - For better installation prompts
3. **HTTPS deployment** - Required for PWA features in production

## üì± Testing PWA Installation
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Serve the build: `npm run preview` or deploy to HTTPS
3. Open in Chrome/Edge on mobile
4. Look for "Add to Home Screen" or install prompt
5. Test offline functionality after installation

## üåê Deployment Requirements
- **HTTPS**: Required for service workers and PWA features
- **Valid SSL certificate**: For secure context
- **Proper server configuration**: To serve the manifest and service worker correctly
